:description: Learn different ways of storing data in your projects

Last week we have seen how to store data into plain text files that can be read by any editor and by other programs. We have also seen that if you separate your data with commas your file will be compatible with other programs, mainly spread sheets. One of the main limitations of this strategy is that if your data contains a comma, your file will not be readable anymore.

In this article we are going to discuss about encoding of data, basically to understand how come that what you save with Python can be read by a normal text editor or your web browser. We will also see that you can save space if you encode your data in the proper way. In the end what you will have is a clear picture of the difference between saving text files and binary data.

What does it really mean to save text files
-------------------------------------------
Last week you have seen different ways of saving text files. One of the most noticeable attributes is that those files can be opened with any basic text editor, you don't need Python to read them. This already should indicate that there is an underlying property that allows programs to share files with each other.

As you have probably heard already, computers don't understand about letters, or colors, they only understand about 1's and 0's. So, there should be a way of translating that information into a letter (or a number, or a color). That is called an encoding. Probably we have already heard about ascii or unicode. Those are standards that specify how to translate from a stream of bytes (i.e. 1's and 0's) to the letters you are seeing now on the screen.

ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a standard that specifies how to translate numbers to characters. If you look at the `ASCII table <https://www.asciitable.com/>`_, you see that it specifies how to translate from 0 to 127 to characters. 128 options is not a random choice, it is 7-bit, or all the combinations that a sequence of 7 1's and 0's can generate. You can see also the extended ascii table, which adds all the characters up to a number of 255 (i.e. 8-bit).

Let's do a quick test. We can create an array of integers between 0 and 255 (8-bit) and store it to a file, and then compare the size of that file with the size of the array. The code will look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    import numpy as np

    x = np.linspace(0, 255, 256, dtype=np.uint8)

    with open('AA_data.dat', 'w') as f:
        for data in x:
            f.write(str(data)+'\n')


Each element of the array is 8-bits long (or 1 byte). We are storing 256 elements, and therefore we expect the file to be 256 bytes in size. However, if you check it, you will see that it is bigger than that: around 914 bytes. This difference is not negligible, so where is it coming from?

We have stored 256 elements, but there more numbers in the file. 10 elements are 1-digit long, 90 are 2-digits and 156 are 3-digits long. In total, there are 658 digits, plus 256 new line characters. If you add them up you get exactly 914. This means that each character is taking exactly 1 byte, or 8 bits.

When you want to write a ``1``, it takes 1 byte. However, when you store a ``10`` it will take 2 bytes. You have to remember that, in the space of integer numbers of 8 bits, they both take the same amount of memory. With this simple example you start seeing that there are a lot of small issues that you have to take into account when saving data.

Different encodings for text data
---------------------------------
You may have realized in the previous section that ASCII is limited to a special set of characters. If you want to write characters of other languages, for example, such as Ã± from Spanish, you will need to resort to other standards. This gave raise to a myriad of different encodings, with a small degree of compatibility between them.

When you open a text file, the program needs to translate from bytes to characters, basically by looking up on a table. If you change the table, you change the output. If you use text editors such as Notepad ++ you will see that you can specify the encoding of the file. If you play with it, you will see that the output may change, especially if there are special characters from other languages.

The problem got worst with websites having users from different countries expecting to use different characters. That is why a superseding standard appeared, called `Unicode <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode>`_. Unicode includes and expands the ascii table up to 32-bit characters, which is billions of different choices. Unicode includes thousands of symbols from modern and ancient languages, plus all the emojis you are already familiar with.

If you want to specify the encoding used while saving a file, you can do the following:

.. code-block:: python

    import codecs

    data_to_save = 'Data to Save'
    with codecs.open('AB_unicode.dat', 'w', 'utf-8') as f:
        f.write(data_to_save)

In the code about, the important part is the line that says ``utf-8``. Unicode has different implementations; each use a different amount of bits per character. You can choose 8, 16 and 32. You can also change the encoding for ``ascii``. Compare how much space it takes every time you save the data. Open the file being saved with a text editor and check if you can see the message.

Saving Numpy Arrays
-------------------
Last week we have seen that it is possible to save numpy arrays into text files that can be read by any editor. This means that the information will be converted
